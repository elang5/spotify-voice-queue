# When You Wake Up - Do This! ☀️

## Your app is converted to bare React Native! Voice will work now! 🎤

### Quick Start (3 steps)

1. **Build the app:**
   ```bash
   cd mobile
   eas build --profile development --platform android
   ```
   (Takes 10-15 min - grab coffee ☕)

2. **While it builds, start your backend:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   netlify dev
   ```

   And in another terminal:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 8888
   ```

3. **After build completes:**
   - Download the APK
   - Install on your Android device
   - Start dev server:
     ```bash
     cd mobile
     npx expo start --dev-client --tunnel
     ```
   - Open app and scan QR code
   - **TEST VOICE!** Tap mic button, say "Add Bohemian Rhapsody to queue"

### What's Working Now

✅ Voice recognition (`@react-native-voice/voice`)
✅ Real-time search
✅ AI Playlist Generator
✅ Queue management
✅ Spotify auth
✅ Beautiful UI

### Why This Works

- Converted to **bare React Native** (no Expo restrictions)
- Fixed AndroidX conflicts in gradle
- Native voice module properly linked
- All permissions configured
