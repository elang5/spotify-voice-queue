# Bare React Native Setup Complete! ðŸŽ‰

Your app has been converted to **bare React Native** and voice recognition is now properly configured with `@react-native-voice/voice`.

## What Changed

### 1. **Ejected from Expo Managed Workflow**
- Generated native `android/` and `ios/` folders
- You now have full control over native code
- No more Expo package restrictions!

### 2. **Voice Recognition Installed**
- âœ… `@react-native-voice/voice@3.2.4` installed
- âœ… AndroidManifest.xml has `RECORD_AUDIO` permission
- âœ… AndroidX conflicts resolved in build.gradle
- âœ… voiceService.ts restored to use react-native-voice

### 3. **Build Configuration**
- AndroidX library conflicts forced to resolve correctly
- Old Android Support libraries excluded
- Native modules properly linked

## How to Build & Test

### Option 1: Build with EAS (Cloud Build - Recommended)

```bash
cd mobile
eas build --profile development --platform android
```

- Takes 10-15 minutes
- Download APK and install on device
- Voice recognition will work!

### Option 2: Build Locally (Requires Android Studio)

If you have Android Studio installed:

```bash
cd mobile
npx expo run:android
```

- Builds and installs app on connected device/emulator
- Starts Metro bundler automatically
- Hot reload works perfectly

## Development Workflow

### Start Dev Server
```bash
cd mobile
npx expo start --dev-client --tunnel
```

### Making Changes
1. Edit your code
2. Changes hot reload automatically
3. No rebuild needed unless you:
   - Add/remove native modules
   - Change AndroidManifest.xml
   - Modify gradle files

### Building Again
Only rebuild when you add new native packages or change native config:
```bash
eas build --profile development --platform android
```

## Current Features Working

âœ… **Voice Recognition** - Tap microphone FAB button
âœ… **Real-time Search** - Search results appear as you type
âœ… **AI Playlist Generator** - Tap playlist icon in header
âœ… **Real-time Now Playing** - Updates every 5 seconds
âœ… **Queue Management** - Add songs, view queue
âœ… **Spotify Auth** - Login/logout functionality

## Testing Voice Recognition

1. Open the app
2. Tap the microphone FAB button (bottom right)
3. Say: "Add Bohemian Rhapsody to queue"
4. The song should be added!

Voice commands supported:
- "Add [song name] to queue"
- "Play [song name]"
- "Queue [song name]"

## Playlist Generator (Requires Re-login)

The backend now has updated Spotify scopes for playlist generation:
1. Logout from the app (header button)
2. Login again (requests new scopes)
3. Tap playlist icon in header
4. Select mood/genre or describe what you want
5. AI generates a playlist!

## Backend Status

Your backend is running with:
- âœ… Spotify auth with playlist scopes
- âœ… ngrok tunnel at: `https://semidramatic-stasia-parallactically.ngrok-free.dev`
- âœ… Voice queue endpoints
- âœ… Playlist generation endpoints

**Make sure your backend is running:**
```bash
cd backend
netlify dev
```

**And ngrok tunnel:**
```bash
ngrok http 8888
```

## Next Steps

1. **Build the app** with `eas build --profile development --platform android`
2. **Install APK** on your Android device
3. **Start dev server** with `npx expo start --dev-client --tunnel`
4. **Test voice recognition!**

## Troubleshooting

### If build fails with AndroidX conflicts:
The gradle configuration should handle this, but if you still see conflicts, the force resolution strategy in `android/build.gradle` should fix it.

### If voice doesn't work:
Make sure you granted microphone permissions when the app first requested them.

### If app won't connect to dev server:
Make sure you're using `--dev-client` flag (not `--go`) and scanning QR code from within the development build app (not Expo Go).

## iOS Support

To build for iOS:
1. You need a Mac with Xcode
2. Run: `eas build --profile development --platform ios`
3. Install via TestFlight or ad-hoc distribution

Voice recognition will work on iOS too - the `@react-native-voice/voice` package supports both platforms!
