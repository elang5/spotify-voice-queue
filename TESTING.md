# Testing Guide

How to test all features of Spotify Voice Queue.

## Pre-Test Setup

1. **Ensure Spotify is Active**
   - Open Spotify on any device (phone, computer, web)
   - Start playing a song
   - This creates an "active device" for the API

2. **Backend Running**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```
   Should see: `Server running on http://127.0.0.1:8888`

3. **Mobile App Running**
   ```bash
   cd mobile
   npm start
   ```
   Then press `a` (Android) or `i` (iOS)

## Test Plan

### 1. Authentication Flow âœ“

**Steps:**
1. App opens to login screen
2. Click "Connect with Spotify"
3. Browser opens with Spotify login
4. Enter your Spotify credentials
5. Grant permissions
6. Browser redirects back to app

**Expected:**
- Smooth transition to home screen
- No errors in console

**Common Issues:**
- Redirect URI mismatch â†’ Check Spotify Dashboard
- "Invalid client" â†’ Check Client ID in .env

## Backend API Testing

### Direct API Tests (using curl or Postman)

**Test OAuth:**
```bash
# Open in browser:
http://127.0.0.1:8888/api/auth/login
```

**Test Queue (need access token):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8888/api/queue \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "Bohemian Rhapsody"}'
```

**Test Playlists:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8888/api/playlists \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"mood": "energetic", "limit": 10}'
```
